 <item> <title>Whose Glory Are You Living For?</title>
 <link>http://rhc.po.sg/sermons/whose-glory-are-you-living</link>
 <description>God, through Haggai the prophet, encourages the people to be strong and build His house.  We need not fear the future, because we know the promises that God has made to us, that he is faithful to keep those promises, and that his Holy Spirit remains with us.</description>

 <item> <title>Whose House Are You Building?</title>
 <link>http://rhc.po.sg/sermons/whose-house-are-you-building</link>
 <description>We are called to build God&#039;s house.  The pursuit of our own glory ironically destroys our ability to enjoy life, but God in love has pursued us to restore us to Him that we might glory in Him.  In this context, God sends the prophet Haggai to stir His people to return to the work of rebuilding the temple.</description>

 <item> <title>A Heart of True Wisdom</title>
 <link>http://rhc.po.sg/sermons/heart-true-wisdom</link>
 <description>God is eternal and glorious, while our lives on earth pass by quickly like a mist.  This awareness of the fleeting nature of life, in contrast with God&#039;s everlasting greatness and righteousness, should lead us to worship Him and live all our days for His glorious purpose.</description>

 <link>http://rhc.po.sg/sermons/weep-no-more-worship-lamb</link>
 <description>At Christmas we remember that Jesus came as the sacrificial Lamb to ransom us from sin and darkness.  We no longer need to be sad, but we can rejoice.  Jesus alone is worthy because he alone can redeem us.</description>

 <item> <title>God Has Spoken Through His Son</title>
 <link>http://rhc.po.sg/sermons/god-has-spoken-through-his-son</link>
 <description>God has spoken to us fully and finally through His Son who is the exact imprint of the Father.  Jesus, the son, who is fully God, is better than prophets and angels, has worked in creation and for our redemption, and now has authority as the inheritor of the world who sits at the Father&#039;s right hand.  We should bow before Jesus in worship, and then live by faith in His name.</description>
