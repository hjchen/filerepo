I would let nature run its course. Whether love comes my way or not, so be it. I wouldn\u2019t rule out any possibility or force things to happen.\u201D<br \/>Four months after parting ways with her ex-boyfriend, the starlet now hopes to explore her options without setting any restrictions. In fact, Julie was so deeply affected by the failed relationship that she wallowed in unhappiness for a month before she moved on, thanks to encouragement from her family and friends.<br \/>\u201CI wasted too much time on a single person [in the past]. My life basically revolved around him. I\u2019m 22 now and I will turn 30 in eight years. If I don\u2019t work hard for my career now, I would regret it in the future!\u201D she exclaimed.<br \/>During the interview, we couldn\u2019t help noticing Julie\u2019s compliments about Allen \u2013 \u201CHe has a very good personality. He\u2019s a nice guy!\u201D<br \/>Nevertheless, the chirpy actress refused to make comparisons between her ex-beau and Allen. \u201CThere\u2019s nothing between us yet, so I don\u2019t want to frighten anyone away,\u201D Julie asserted, while giving her word that she would announce it if she does get attached.<br \/><strong>Learning independence at 22<\/strong><br \/>Unbeknownst to many, Julie moved out of her family house to live on her own two months ago.<br \/>\u201CMy mum said that it was time for me to be independent. I spent quite some time looking for a unit,\u201D she revealed. \u201CI\u2019m now residing in a one-room apartment. I have a good friend who shuttles between Taiwan and Singapore. She would stay with me when she\u2019s in town.\u201D<br \/>While sharing about her newfound autonomy, Julie recalled how her mother was so impressed about her washing the dishes, when the latter came over for a visit. For someone who is capable of cooking herself a nice meal, the actress has no problems living alone for now.<br \/>After wrapping filming for Ch8\u2019s upcoming drama <em>Tiger Mummy<\/em>, Julie will begin work for <em>The Journey: Our Homeland <\/em>where she plays a tomboyish character named Yao Jia Hui.<br \/>Earlier this year, the ambitious thespian participated in a movie called <em>Mystery<\/em> that has recently opened in Chinese cinemas.

As a result, his weight dropped from 83kg to 77kg in just over a month.<\/p>\n <p>He has also cut back on after-work social activities with his <em>118<\/em> co-stars, who usually go out for meals after a day of filming.

However, Mark turned out to be an extremely conservative man with strong moral values and hence, he refused to intrude into other people\u2019s privacy.<br \/>Although Mark and Yan Neo were at loggerheads in the beginning due to conflicting opinions, they started seeing a different side of each other after experiencing several incidents together.<br \/><img alt=\"Elvin Ng and Mindee Ong\" src=\"http:\/\/feeds.wcms.mediacorp.sg\/blob\/1499054\/1417163612000\/elvin-ng-2-data.jpg\" \/><br \/>Unlike his rational personality in the show, Elvin is, in fact, an emotional person who is exceptionally devoted when it comes to romance.

Yet, as he grows older, he gradually realised that this method is not as feasible as before. \u201CYou need to give yourself time and space to collect your thoughts before moving on,\u201D he added.<br \/>While the Chinese title of <em>Let It Go<\/em> literally translates to \u201CHappy Break-up\u201D, the heartthrob believes that it is impossible to be happy after going separate ways with a lover. \u201CThe emotional reliance between two people cannot be demolished so easily.

To her surprise, Andie took initiative to text her and discuss their roles before filming commenced, which left a good impression on the actress.<br \/>The relationship between Felicia and Romeo\u2019s characters is at the other end of the spectrum. Crazed by his \u201Clove\u201D and possessiveness, Zhang Yan locked his non-blood related cousin Zhang Min in an abandoned building, where he sexually assaulted her.<br \/>\u201CEveryone was very serious, but there were also some comedic moments,\u201D Felicia recalled. \u201CI was completely enveloped with emotions, but when Romeo leaned in to forcibly kiss me, I burst out laughing!\u201D<br \/>And the reason for that is because of Romeo\u2019s facial hair. \u201CWhen he is tired, his moustache grows very fast. We filmed that scene in the afternoon and his moustache had grown out by then, so it felt very ticklish!\u201D she chuckled.<br \/>Although Felicia claimed to have good chemistry with Romeo, the actress was \u201Cawakened by his kiss\u201D and could not stop laughing even after several takes. In the end, Romeo had to shave on the spot before filming continued.<br \/>However, the giggly actress insisted that there was no awkwardness as she is very close to Romeo in real life. \u201CIt makes filming easier when we are familiar with each other.

I haven\u2019t really thought about it (Star Awards), but it would definitely be a huge encouragement if I do get nominated,\u201D the actress humbly replied.<br \/>Three months of filming in Ipoh certainly forged a strong bond between the cast of <em>The Journey: Tumultuous Times<\/em>.

In the roundtable interview, the actress likened her involvement in this movie to that of a courtship process between the movie\u2019s director Randy Ang and her \u2013 one which started as early as last year.<br \/>It all began when Randy sent her the first draft of the movie\u2019s script for perusal, she recalled. \u201CI felt that there were some things lacking in the character and the dynamics between her character and Seng\u2019s character (James Seah). At that time, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed if that was the final script,\u201D she added, emphasising that her decision to be part of this movie was in no part related to Yuwu\u2019s role in it.<br \/>According to Joanne, Randy paid heed to her comments and feedback about the character and got back to her with subsequent drafts, which eventually led to her going on board the project.<br \/>\u201CHe put in the changes and I thought, \u2018Ok, that\u2019s making sense\u2019 and they got serious about casting me. That\u2019s why I agreed to do it. It\u2019s about the story and character.

Will it help you bring anything different to the movie?<\/strong><br \/>I\u2019m not quite sure if it has got anything to do with being married but I have always wanted to focus on the craft all these while. I think the last interview I did with 8 DAYS, [I said] it\u2019s really all about the craft and everything else is just part of life. If you ask me \u2013 life has taken me to a different stage. I\u2019d have a lot more experience that could help, but who knows \u2013 it could also be a stumbling block because you know too much\u2026 I just want to focus on being in that moment and not knowing too much about what\u2019s going to happen next and then react to that. That\u2019d be the most real and genuine performance I can give this movie.<br \/><strong>How similar are you with your character?<\/strong><br \/>I\u2019d say, the most similar thing about the two of us is we just want to do the right thing. We\u2019re not championing any cause; we\u2019re just following our hearts \u2013 what is the right thing to do. You\u2019d see that in the film as well. She has aspirations, like I do. You want to make a good living, I want to make a good film \u2013 so there\u2019s the similarity.<br \/><strong>Now that you\u2019re entering your 30s, what\u2019s most important to you as an actress and as a married woman?<\/strong><br \/>Time is essence as an actor. When you do a drama or movie, it takes up a lot of energy and emotions. For me, to do a project it has got to mean a lot to me. Every project I do is part of life, part of living. Going through emotions and experiences that I \u2026 it\u2019s important now that every project I do means something and I\u2019d have come out of it understanding myself better.

Have you thought about your next milestone? Like having a baby?<\/strong><br \/>I forgot to mention the similarities. The other similarity is the fact that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next \u2013 just like Zhou Jun. Is she going to get married, is she going to have children? Is she going to stay in Singapore or return to China? She doesn\u2019t know. She wants to have a family, wants to make a good living. Is it going to happen? She doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s the same for me right now \u2013 a lot of things sort of take its natural course. Do I want a baby? Yes, when is it going to happen? I don\u2019t know.<br \/><strong>On the note of courtship \u2013 how did he [Yuwu] win your hand?<\/strong><br \/>With sincerity, of course \u2013 like what Randy did with the script (<em>smiles<\/em>).<br \/><strong>One last bit on the marriage \u2013 now that you guys are registered, when would the banquet be held and are you guys planning for it now?<\/strong><br \/>Like I\u2019ve said with the baby \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It [the marriage] just kind of happened; it\u2019s a natural course. Right now, I think I have a movie to worry about, I\u2019m also going to be part of rehearsals till end of the month and I\u2019m also going to do <em>Code of Law 3<\/em>. We have got quite a bit on our plate, so I think that\u2019s going to be the focus for now, for this year at least. We never know what\u2019s going to happen next year so\u2026<br \/><strong>It feels as though you\u2019re more about living life on a whim right now \u2013 doing what your heart tells you to do versus what you should do.<\/strong><br \/>I think now, it\u2019s more about what my heart tells me to do, and not so much about what I should do. Because sometimes you end up doing what you should do and you\u2019re not happy. I think it\u2019s more important to be happy. Life is so short, time flies and gosh before you know it \u2013 I\u2019m a year older and a year older. I\u2019ve come to realise I got to make time mean something to me. If not what have I done when I\u2019m going to look back? It\u2019s really about staying true to your heart, what makes you happy, what is most meaningful to you and so I want to focus on that. I wouldn\u2019t call it living on a whim \u2013 it\u2019s not an irresponsible way of living, but really being responsible to yourself \u2013 which mean different things to different people.<br \/><strong>So are you happy right now?<\/strong><br \/>Of course. What can I ask for? I\u2019m part of an important movie for Singapore [and] it\u2019s going to happen next year with the opening of Capitol. There\u2019s really nothing else I can ask for. Being able to sink my teeth into this role that we can have a discussion, can talk about and create chemistry with \u2013 I think any actress would jump into this.<br \/><br \/><strong>Who are you most excited to work with amongst the cast of 1965?<\/strong><br \/>Well I\u2019m not particularly excited about working with any one person. I\u2019m sort of just taking it easy and quite <em>c\u2019est la vie<\/em> about it. I mean, you can\u2019t \u2013 the things you hold on the hardest to you don\u2019t do a good job out of it, and you lose it in fact. And sometimes the best things happen when you least expect it. I like to stick to that and let the best things happen.<br \/><br \/><em>A dramatic thriller set to premiere next year, 1965 is supported both by the Media Development Authority (MDA) and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) as one of the SG50 films for 2015.

Without all these I think the \u2018Julie Tan\u2019 today would be a very plain and boring person.<br \/><strong>When I was 21, I looked like...<\/strong> a girl turning into a lady (<em>laughs<\/em>). It's a very awkward period! I think I looked like neither here nor there. You want to say I\u2019m a girl \u2013 but I\u2019m not a \u2018girl,\u2019 you want to say I\u2019m a woman \u2013 but I\u2019m not yet a woman. It was an awkward period in terms of presenting myself in the way I behave and the way I act. But one day it dawned on me that I\u2019m just 21, so why am I trying to act like I\u2019m 25?<br \/><strong>The best thing about being 21 is... <\/strong>you'll feel like \u2018I'm forever 21.\u2019 You feel so damn young and think you can do whatever you want and yeah \u2013 \u2018I'm legal man!\u2019 I don\u2019t need my parents\u2019 consent now that I'm officially legal- but that\u2019s not to say I can do illegal things \u2013 but whatever you do, you don't need your parents' consent since you\u2019re an adult now.<br \/><strong>The worst thing about being 21 is...<\/strong> that new identity brings more stress too \u2018cos you're on your own and need to take responsibility of your life. But right now I\u2019m enjoying that process because you're in-charge of your own life and responsible for yourself. No one is responsible for you.<br \/><br \/><img alt=\"When I was 21 with\u2026 Julie Tan\" src=\"http:\/\/feeds.wcms.mediacorp.sg\/blob\/1396726\/1412334535000\/when-i-was-21-with-julie-data.jpg\" \/><br \/><br \/><strong>My 21st birthday celebration was...<\/strong> I had chili crab at home with a few friends and my parents and it was cooked by my friend\u2019s mum. It was a simple meal at home, we nua (relaxed) at home and had crabs. And one day before my birthday, I went to Zouk with my dad and mum to countdown to my birthday too. After I turned 21, we took a family trip to Florence and spent more time with each other.<br \/><strong>The thing I remember most when I was 21 was...<\/strong> I fell really in love (<em>laughs<\/em>).<br \/><strong>I'm looking forward to turning...<\/strong> 30 (<em>laughs<\/em>). I think by then, it'd be a very different phase of life. Either I\u2019d have a family of my own or be doing well in my career. I think it's another stage of life and I\u2019m quite looking forward. But even though I look forward to it, I want to enjoy the process now and live every day to the fullest.<br \/><strong>If I could be 21 again, I would...<\/strong> still fall in love (<em>laughs<\/em>). I'd still dare to love, hate and dare to do what I want because you can only make mistakes when you're young. As you grow older it's harder for you to make mistakes, because it's harder to pick yourself back up.<br \/><strong>The only age better than being 21 is\u2026 <\/strong>16 <strong>because...<\/strong> I remember working so hard to get to where I am today. That period of my life was simple and all I knew was the determination to put in that much effort and hard work to be where I wanted to be. Back then I was more clueless about things and all I knew was that I needed to be very hardworking. I miss that kind of drive - not that I don't have it now, but that's a very nice feeling to have.<br \/>Actually I think I have found that feeling again recently and it makes me very focused about what I should work on.<\/p>\n<\/div>","author":"Joanna Goh","title":"When I was 21 with\u2026 Julie Tan","keywords":"Julie Tan","abstractText":"We check in with the lithe starlet, who just turned 22, on her past coming-of-age year","link":[],"categories":["Celebrity Interviews: MediaCorp stars only"],"date":{"updated":"20141003T191534+0800","published":"20141003T191534+0800"}}]}
